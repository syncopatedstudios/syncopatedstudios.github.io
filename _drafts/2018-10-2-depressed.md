# a headline
At the very least for the next 7 days, i would like to work on dealing with
my depression without effecting other people. Right now I feel very low. Low energy,
low interest. I often find myself reminiscing about the past which leaves me crying
that is no more than a memory. I think I struggle with this more than the anxiety.
It≈õ a sort of a despair that makes it very easy to indulge in the thoughts of suicide.


# another point

if i ever get around to this, itll be neat
