something ir ead about not favoring loudness lead me to go by

this generally focusus on average peak levels. rms levels typicall would be less than a peak level. adjusting for the lower number, i would think, would lend to a less distorted signal when played on any given stereo system.


generally i try to keep things just below -3,-6 dBFS overall

* keep in mind dBFS refers to digital signals....
