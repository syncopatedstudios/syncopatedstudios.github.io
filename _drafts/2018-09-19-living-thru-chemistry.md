lithium

wasn't something i noticed working at first...
  this laed to not taking it during 'high' times

  it seemed to be noitceable in its absense during the xtreme highs and lows
    atributable to inability to control extreme pysocitic episode

no real feeling of "sedation" which was an initial worry
